This site was part of my\r\nfinal project in Kane’s Free\r\nHigh School Data Science Bootcamp, which I decided to partake in due\r\nto my passion in coding, and my goal to become a programmer when I grow\r\nup. Some of my other hobbies include math, science, and biking.\r\nAbout the project\r\nThis project, titled Cars - CO2 Emissions and Effciency, was\r\ninspired by my interest in cars and aims to inform individuals on which\r\nones are most eco-friendly, so they can make the right decision when it\r\ncomes time for them to buy one for themselves. The first graph shows\r\nwhich companies produce the most efficient gas powered cars, the second\r\ncovers both the amount of energy that different electric vehicles take\r\nto drive a kilometer, and their total range, and the final graph shows\r\nthe EV charging stations across Massachusetts.\r\nContact Info\r\nGithub: https://github.com/AkhileshSangaraju\r\nE-mail: sakhileshvarma@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In fact, a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons\r\nof carbon dioxide per year. This is why it is so important to make the\r\nright decision when buying a new car. It could prevent millions of\r\npremature deaths due to air pollution and increased temperatures over\r\nthe next century.\r\nGraphs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Podder 2020)\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe graph above shows the average tailpipe emission of carbon dioxide\r\nthat cars from different companies produce during combined city and\r\nhighway driving. It makes it clear that out of all the gas powered cars\r\nsold in the United States, Honda’s are the most eco-friendly, while\r\nBugatti’s are the least efficient and produce the most CO2. This\r\ninformation is very important when buying a gas powered car, however,\r\nsome people know that they want to go full electric.\r\nThe graph below is interactive! Click Around!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(GEOFF839 2020)\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe graph above is for individuals who want to buy a fully electric\r\ncar, but aren’t sure if the range they offer is sufficient and are\r\nconcerned about how much energy they consume. It shows the mileage of\r\ndifferent EV’s on a full tank and also the number of watts they consume\r\nper kilometer. From looking at the graph, one can quickly deduct that\r\nthe new Tesla Roadster (not in production yet due to supply chain\r\nshortages) has the furthest range, while the Lightyear One is the most\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(BTS 2021)\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe map above contains points that mark the location of different\r\nelectric vehicle charging stations across the state of Massachusetts. It\r\nmakes it clear that there are many charging stations avalable for an\r\nindividual who is looking to buy an electric car, and proves that buying\r\nand daily driving one won’t be a struggle. Along with the fact that they\r\nprovide for a cleaner environment and are easy to charge up, electric\r\nvehicles come with many other benefits too. They deliver a better\r\ndriving experience, they reduce noise pollution, that have increased\r\nresale value, and they have lower maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBTS, USDOT. 2021.
