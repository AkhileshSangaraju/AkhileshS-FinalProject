This site was part of my final project in\r\nKane’s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp, which I decided to join\r\ndue to my passion in coding, and my goal to become a programmer when I\r\ngrow up. Some of my other hobbies include math, science, and biking.\r\nAbout the project\r\nThis project, titled Cars - CO2 Emissions and Effciency, was\r\ninspired by my interest in cars and aims to inform individuals on which\r\nones are most eco-friendly, so they can make the right decision when it\r\ncomes time for them to buy one for themselves. The first graph shows\r\nwhich companies produce the most efficient cars, and the second covers\r\nthe amount of energy that different electric vehicles take to drive a\r\nkilometer.\r\nContact Info\r\nGithub: https://github.com/AkhileshSangaraju\r\nE-mail: sakhileshvarma@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It makes it clear that out of all the gas powered cars\r\nsold in the United States, Honda’s are the most eco-friendly, while\r\nLamborghini’s are the least efficient and produce the most CO2. This\r\ninformation is very important when buying a regular car, however, some\r\npeople know that they want to go full electric.\r\nThe graph below is interactive! Click Around!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(GEOFF839 2020)\r\nThe graph above is for individuals who want to buy a fully electric\r\ncar, but aren’t sure if the range they offer is sufficient and are\r\nconcerned about how much energy they consume. It shows the mileage of\r\ndifferent EV’s on a full tank and also the number of watts they consume\r\nper kilometer. From looking at the graph, one can quickly deduct that\r\nthe new Tesla Roadster (not in production yet due to supply chain\r\nshortages) has the furthest range, while the Lightyear One is the most\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(BTS 2021)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBTS, USDOT. 2021.
